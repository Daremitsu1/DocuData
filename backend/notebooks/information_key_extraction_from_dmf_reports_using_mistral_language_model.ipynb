    "As text data continues to grow rapidly, extracting meaningful insights from large amounts of information is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing unstructured data, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction. One of the key tasks that can be performed using large language models is entity extraction, which involves identifying and classifying entities—such as names, organizations, locations, dates, and other specific details—within a text.\n",

    "In this sample, we will explore how information extraction works using the Mistral language model in the EntityRecognizer class of the arcgis.learn API with the Cheshire fire incident reports dataset. The Cheshire fire dataset includes incident reports detailing fire incidents in Cheshire, covering information like locations, times, types of incidents, and response actions. This data can be valuable for analysis in understanding patterns, improving response strategies, and enhancing safety measures.\n",
